= Simple Logger

Even though Log4j Core is the reference implementation of xref:manual/api.adoc[Log4j API], Log4j API itself also provides a very minimalist implementation: link:../javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/simple/SimpleLogger.html[`SimpleLogger`].
This is a convenience for environments where either a fully-fledged logging implementation is missing, or cannot be included for other reasons.
`SimpleLogger` is the default Log4j API implementation if no other is available in the classpath.

[#config]
== Configuration

`SimpleLogger` can be configured using the following system properties:

include::partial$manual/systemproperties/properties-simple-logger.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

=== Thread context

Simple Logger supports the same properties as Log4j Core for the configuration of the thread context.
See xref:manual/systemproperties.adoc#properties-thread-context[] for details.
